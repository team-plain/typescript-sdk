    # Why is 'entry' not queried?
    # --
    # We could be querying for the `entry` we just created here
    # but in practice this is of little value and it's a huge
    # union of all possible entries etc. This means that we'd have to
    # carefully keep it in sync with every newly created timeline entry.
    # 
    # If we were to add an entry and forget to add it here the returned
    # response would be confusing since it would not include the created
    # content.
    # 
    # For this reason, for now, we are omiting entry from this query.
