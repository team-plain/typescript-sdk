  The breaking changes are as follows:

  ## Customer changes

  The `customer` object has been simplified thanks to the introduction of the `Thread` object. Specifically the following fields were removed:

  - `status`
  - `statusChangedAt`
  - `assignedToUser`
  - `assignedAt`
  - `lastIdleAt`

  The following related methods have been removed from the client:

  - `changeCustomerStatus`

  Issues have been removed and replaced with [Labels](https://www.plain.com/docs/graphql/labels).

  The following related methods have been removed from the client:

  - `createIssue`
  - `resolveIssue`
  - `deleteIssue`
  - `getIssues`

  ## Custom Timeline Entries

  Custom timeline entries have been split into two more specific APIs: [threads](https://www.plain.com/docs/graphql/threads) and [events](https://www.plain.com/docs/graphql/events).

  The following methods have been removed from the client:

  - `upsertCustomTimelineEntry`

  ## Chat

  Chat support in Plain has been deprecated. As a replacement you may want to consider building a [contact form](https://www.plain.com/docs/contact-forms-setup) instead.

    const res = await client.upsertCustomer({
      identifier: {
        email: 'foo@bar.com',
      },

        fullName: 'Foo Bar',
        email: {
          email: 'foo@bar.com',
          isVerified: true,
        },
      },
      onUpdate: {},
    });

    if (res.error) {
      console.error(res.error);
      throw new Error(res.error.message);
    }

  -  console.log(`Created customer with id=${res.data.id}`);
  +  console.log(`Created customer with id=${res.data.customer.id}`);
  ```
